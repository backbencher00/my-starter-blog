Advance Data Science

Today I started a course of advanced data science and I was amazed by the fact that how a technology is developing, In the first task of the assignment I had told to creat a spark environment in Watson studio on IBM cloud and what I saw there is a video of auto AI of Watson studio, canâ€™t imagine till now what Auto AI can do, You have to just upload your data set on Auto AI and all set, It will do all your work from splitting the data in training and testing set to selecting best model of ML to train the data and it can auto select the pipelines and can give the different value of RMSE and MSE obtained from different pipelines, you can also deploy the model by clicking a single button and it will provide a whole notebook of jupyter in python or in any other language that support ML frame work,
I am so glanced by looking that it took me just 5 minute to do all the things in one go doing all such things which I had learnt so far in data science.
I have completed the task on watson studio of creating an spark environment in python to get start with Apache spark.

After some time I will provide the mathematics used on data science and Machine Learning in a very simple way so that you guys can learn I have seen on internet there is lot of big big mathematical expression used which causing anxiety believe me that is not that much hard, I will try to present them in fornt of you guy so that you understand them in a simplest way
