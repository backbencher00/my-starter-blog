Different companies have different coding rounds and most of them check your problem solving skills and your knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms. I have read the book [Cracking The Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.in/Cracking-the-Coding-Interview/dp/0984782869/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/257-1348683-7477109?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0984782869&pd_rd_r=a88966b5-e834-47ca-a8bf-0478ec8beb56&pd_rd_w=pAAzj&pd_rd_wg=6kFSB&pf_rd_p=8fa1f3a8-c3ee-4cde-8295-5699918f5887&pf_rd_r=J4E4KVTWHSD2SH01CHMM&psc=1&refRID=J4E4KVTWHSD2SH01CHMM) which is a really good book for coding interview preparation.

If you have more then 2 weeks for your coding interview preparation and you have to already done Data Structures and problem solving, then you should definitely go for this book.
It can be ordered from Amazon and is also easily available in the market. This is the best book you can invest in which will not only give you knowledge but also boost your confidence for the interview. Apart from this, the night previous of the interview, go through each and every interview question on youtube, for which the link is provided below.

>[Company-wise list of questions of Top Companies](https://github.com/twowaits/SDE-Interview-Questions)

All product based companies ask similar questions which are generally repeated by the same or different company. So, it is recommended to go through all the questions provided on the youtube link.

Also go through [Tech Dose](https://www.youtube.com/c/TECHDOSE4u/featured) channel. The guy in the channel has an excellent way of explaining the approach to a problem.

For reference to problem solving, you can go through this youtube channel [Gaurav Sen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRPMAqdtSgd0Ipeef7iFsKw).

In the interviews for SDE2 and SDE3 they will ask System design questions which you can learn from this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpDnVSmNFX0&list=PLMCXHnjXnTnvo6alSjVkgxV-VH6EPyvoX).
