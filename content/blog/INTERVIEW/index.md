See different companies have different coding round and  most of them will check your problem solving skills and knowledge of Data structure and algorithm, I have read [Cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.in/Cracking-the-Coding-Interview/dp/0984782869/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/257-1348683-7477109?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0984782869&pd_rd_r=a88966b5-e834-47ca-a8bf-0478ec8beb56&pd_rd_w=pAAzj&pd_rd_wg=6kFSB&pf_rd_p=8fa1f3a8-c3ee-4cde-8295-5699918f5887&pf_rd_r=J4E4KVTWHSD2SH01CHMM&psc=1&refRID=J4E4KVTWHSD2SH01CHMM) which is really nice book if you have done the Data structure and problem solving and you still got a more than 2 weeks then buy this book you can have it from amazon or offline in the market but this is the best book you can have which will not only give you knowledge but also increase your confidence apart from this one night before the interview go through each and every interview question on youtube I am providing the link below
