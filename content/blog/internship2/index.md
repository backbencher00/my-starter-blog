Worked in DIC, funded by ministry of human resources and development government of India (set up by central government in premium institute for research and development) development with team of medical devices and restorative technology as a Deep Learning Intern.

At present, I am contributing in the organisation as a Technical Team Member, building an ecosystem in which we are trying to shift the work of organisation to an open source platform so that others maintainers/contributors/projects around the world can also collaborate on a large scale.

As part of my internship, I worked on the CNN neural Networks, performed denoising with the help of autoencoders with LSTM layers and segmentation with double-Unet for the project of prediction and classification of pancreatic cancer of dicom images. Apart from that, our team has converted dicom images into png files.
