## How it all started?
Innow8 Apps came in my college for summmer intern hiring, They conducted two test first was the basic apptitude test in which there are 40 question based on logical reasoning and numerical ability and second one is programming in which they set 3 basics program 1. factorial with recursion , 2 kadane's algorithm, and 3. conversion of numerical string into Integers. I was able to do all the three program.

There are 2 round of interview 1st. Technical Interview Where they asked me saveral question Including
1. Pattern printing question and 
2. Find the length of linked list
3. what is a Inheritance 
4. what is a difference between Tuble and list

In HR round they asked me

2. your strength and weakness
3. what are your expectation with this internship
## Learnings from the experience

As part of my internship, 
In first two weaks of the internships they teach basics of javascript and ReactJS and after I worked with React development team where I have worked majorly on 2 projects 
1. E-commerce website in which I have fixed the bug of user panel in payment gateway, 

2. I have worked on a video calling application, In which I gave worked on video plugins , I have fixed the bug of of multiple triggering. 



Apart from the technical skills, working together as a team on a particular project has really improved by soft skills as I was able to:

* Communicate my ideas in clear terms with my team
* Collaborate with the team to uncover creative ideas and share different perspectives and experiences on tasks
* Apply the concepts learnt to find answers to problems and formulate workable solutions
* Accommodate my teamâ€™s needs as the Query Analyst by relaying queries from my team to Hamoye.

Before this Internship I always used to understimate myself in devlopment , 
This internship build my confidence and Taught me how you can fixes bugs with the help of google and stakeoverflow, 
This internship also teach me to use google in a different way. Which I think the best Part of my Internship.
