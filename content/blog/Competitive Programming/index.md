### Lets choose a programming language. 
You can have any language c, cpp, python,

But I personally prefer Cpp because of the dirversity of this language and the best library it can offer to write any alorithm

It is one of the fastest language because it is closest to the compiler

It is the extension of the C language ,most of the higher label language weather that are scripting or non scripting language are written in C

### Learn Data Structure and Algorithms
These are the some links to learn DSA from different platform
