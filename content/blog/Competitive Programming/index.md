### Choose a Programming language
You can have any language c, cpp, python,etc.

But I personally prefer C++ because of the dirversity of this language and the best library it can offer to write any alorithms

It is one of the fastest language because it is closest to the compiler

It is the extension of the C language, most of the higher lavel languages weather that are scripting or non-scripting language are written in C

To start a journy of your competitive programming you can go to either codechef or codeforce.
There are contest on codeforces and codechef, Participate in contents to increase your rating.
If you are beginner start with codechef but do give contest on both the platform. I would prefer you guys to solve atleast 75 question of Beginner, level 50 of easy, 30 of medium, and 20 hard level on codechef to improve your problem solving skills

>Phase of problem solving 

- Read the problem carefully and understand them and don't be in hurry
- Check the constraints very very carefully because sometimes they give good hint. 
- Start thinking about the solution(brute force approach) in your mind a basic approach
- Write down the algorithm that come in your mind
- Get a dry run of in notebook and try to pass the test case given in the problem.
- Code it.
- Try to further optimise it, but don't give so much time. Sometimes brute force approach is the best approach.
- you can also see if there is a possibilty where you can minimize the number of iteration by giving some condition in a form of if-else statement inside the loop or by using some mathematical expression
- Don't be demotivate if your test cases is not passing or you are not able to think the solution
- Last see the solution in which we engineers are good and don't just see it brother, You need to code it and compile it. 


### Learn Data Structure and Algorithms

Learn the data structure and algorithm and go through with every data structure practice question learn to implement them practically 

#### Important Topics
- Array
- Queue and Stack
- Linklist
- Tree
- BST
- [Segement(used multiple times in competitive programming)](https://youtu.be/FR5d4V7Z9SE)
- Graph

### Learn STL C++

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators.

>STL has four components

- Algorithms
- Containers
- Functions
- Iterators

##### Containers

 These are the important containers learn to implement them by practice question on each container i have also provided the link of tutorials to learnt them 
 - [priority_queue(also known as heap)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/priority-queue-in-cpp-stl/)
 - [set](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/set-in-cpp-stl/)
 - [unordered_set](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unordered_set-in-cpp-stl/)(hashtable)
 - [map](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/map-associative-containers-the-c-standard-template-library-stl/)
 - [unordered_map](geeksforgeeks.org/unordered_map-in-cpp-stl/)
 - [forward_list](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/forward-list-c-set-1-introduction-important-functions/)(linklist) 

 - [list](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/list-cpp-stl/)(doubly linklist)
