### Lets choose a programming language. 
You can have any language c, cpp, python,etc.

But I personally prefer Cpp because of the dirversity of this language and the best library it can offer to write any alorithm

It is one of the fastest language because it is closest to the compiler

It is the extension of the C language ,most of the higher label language weather that are scripting or non scripting language are written in C

## Learn Data Structure and Algorithms

Learn the data structure and algorithm and go through with every data structure practice question learn to implement them practically 

#### Important Topics you should go through with 
> - Array
> - Queue and Stack
> - Linklist
> - Tree
> - BST
> - Segement(used multiple times in competitive programming) [link](https://youtu.be/FR5d4V7Z9SE)
> - Graph

### Learn STL C++
The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators.
[link-to-my-notes] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u4vM0wm5YjGiSmBvtDtX2ZXjZK9eBxKgCvoLT907K5c/edit?usp=sharing)

STL has four components

> Algorithms
> Containers
> Functions
> Iterators

##### containers

 These are the important containers learn to implement them by practice question on each container i have also provided the link of tutorials to learnt them 

> - priority_queue(also known as heap) [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/priority-queue-in-cpp-stl/)
> - set [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/set-in-cpp-stl/)
> - unordered_set(hashtable) [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unordered_map-in-cpp-stl/)
> - map [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/map-associative-containers-the-c-standard-template-library-stl/)
> - unordered_map [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unordered_map-in-cpp-stl/)
> - forward_list(linklist) [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/forward-list-c-set-1-introduction-important-functions/)
> - list(doubly linklist) [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/list-cpp-stl/)
