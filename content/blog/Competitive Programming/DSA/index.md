## A breaf introduction of data structure and algorithms
There is lot of confusion between the competitive programming and DSA but let me tell you the difference first
competitive programming improves your problem solving approach and implementation,
It teaches you how to think?
and by building your CP profile you are increasing your chance in resume sortlisting
Data structure is something you learn about how to handle and organize the different data structure,
how we can allocate different type of memory in different datastructure?
Many student have the confusion that in company interview what they gonna ask so they will ask the data structure question
and your competitive programming skills make you think to solve the problem related to data structure
in this blog I will provide the best tracked  content so that you cannot search again and again 
>In sort CP = Resume sortlisting
>DSA = coding  Interview 
To learn these content dont pay 10k or any amount they'll just provide the same content in the ordered manner thats it 
Dont spend to much time in thinking the solution and approach more that 30 minutes and if you think you be able to think the approach then try to code it but do not involve more then 1 hours  if you getting any error, just see the solution where and what mistake you are doing and if you dont able to think the approach dont be demotivated may be you does not spend much time in getting these concept you'll learn eventually  you guys dont know but i took whole day just to write hello world on hackerrank 1st problem and here i am now 
## there are two type of data structure
>Primitive Data structure
>Non-primitive Data structure
The primitive data Structure
    >int(integer type)
    >char(character type)
    >float(float type)
    >*(pointer)
Non -primitive data srtructure
    >linear(these are the data structure in which one element is connect to another in linear fashion)
      >Array
      >linked list
      >stack and queues

    >non linear(when one element is connected to 2 or more than 2 element )
       >trees 
       >graph  
Major operation 
 to learn how to implement any data structure linear or non- linear you need to learn 5 basic operation that should be your initial goal before going to the problems of any of the data structure
 >searching
 >sorting
 >insertion
 >updation
 >deletion
